== 1.1 Introduction to this module

This module shows how developers can build, deploy, and manage applications using Red Hat Developer Hub. Red Hat Developer Hub will allow you to perform the Software Development activities with an accelerated approach by reducing developer friction and improving time to market.

The module starts with the product overview, followed by its architecture and a tour of the main functionalities. 
You will implement two use cases, from *maintaining a new application* that requires bug fixing to *modernizing a set of microservices* by moving them into OpenShift.

== 1.2 Red Hat Developer Hub Overview

=== 1.2.1 What is Red Hat Developer Hub?

https://developers.redhat.com/rhdh[Red Hat Developer Hub^] is an enterprise-grade, open system for building developer portals containing a supported and opinionated framework. Red Hat Developer Hub helps reduce friction and frustration for engineering teams while boosting their productivity and increasing their organization's competitive advantages. Red Hat Developer Hub is based on the upstream project https://backstage.spotify.com/[Backstage^]. 

Red Hat Developer Hub can build and deploy applications on the hybrid cloud supporting diverse infrastructure such as cloud services and on-prem. 

=== 1.2.2 Current Business Challenges
* Time to market: The learning curve required to create, build and maintain containers slow down software development
* Hiring, Retaining, and Training Technical Experts: Time spent and resource availability decrease the opportunity to scale technical skills into the organization at different levels.
* Reducing technical debt through modernization: Disperse and complex technologies required to adopt containers, Kubernetes, cloud, CI/CD
* Remain competitive: How to adopt best practices in each stage of the application delivery lifecycle to allow developers to focus on innovation.
* Remain competitive: Feature development competes with modernization efforts reducing the opportunity for modernization.
* Time to market: Lacking a self-service developer experience increases the time spent modernizing applications.

=== 1.2.3 Current Developer Challenges
* Learning multiple technologies besides their software tools such as CI/CD, Security, Containers, Cloud.
* Working on repetitive tasks when automation and best practices are not implemented
* Spending time when lack of patterns and guidelines are not implemented
* Context switching between a diverse number of tools 

=== 1.2.3 Red Hat Developer Hub Benefits

The Red Hat® Developer Hub is a developer portal that promotes efficiency and collaboration by visually consolidating elements of the development process. It streamlines onboarding speed, developer productivity, and collaboration through a unified and open platform while reducing cognitive load and frustration for the development team. With pre-architected and supported approaches, and by centralizing technology resources, developer focus can center on delivering a competitive advantage for their organization.


Development teams can help make sure workflows run smoothly by providing the right tools, validated environments, and on-demand services. Confidence is gained that software will adhere to organizational best practices and standards without introducing unnecessary bureaucracy. Maintenance becomes more manageable, and future teams can easily assume control within a known, trusted environment, while also enhancing governance. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/developer-hub[More information^]

* Continue exploring the menu:

** Go back to the https://developer-hub-backstage-rhdhub.%SUBDOMAIN%[Red Hat Developer Hub UI^]


* *Tech Radar*: Company radar to understand their modernization technology landscape. This information will be customized by each company. For more information, visit our product page https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_developer_hub/1.1/html/administration_guide_for_red_hat_developer_hub/rhdh-installing-dynamic-plugins[about plugins configuration^]

image:intro/tech_radar.png[width=100%] 


* *Create*: Developers can build and deploy their applications by creating a component by choosing a pre-defined template. You will spend most of your time during this module on this feature.

image:intro/software_templates_all.png[width=120%] 

*Software Templates* are built based on best practices to create a repeatable process for developers.

Find more information about the Red Hat Developer Hub https://developers.redhat.com/rhdh[here^].

=== 1.4.3 Explore Software Templates

Each Software Template is already built based on Application architectures and frameworks such as Quarkus, Spring Boot, and Angular. 
The templates are composed of everything that is required for an application to be built, deployed and managed in *OpenShift*. 

The Software templates are stored on our instance of GitLab created for this workshop.

* Explore the templates available:
** Access from your web browser our https://gitlab-gitlab.%SUBDOMAIN%/rhdhub/software-templates[GitLab^] instance.
** You are on the Software Templates repository, *rhdhub/software-templates*.
** Click on the *showcase-templates.yaml* file. This file defines the templates shown on the Software Templates web page on Red Hat Developer Hub.
** In this file, you will see all the defined templates per each application type:
    - scaffolder-templates/frontend/template.yaml
    - scaffolder-templates/spring-backend/template.yaml
    - scaffolder-templates/quarkus-backend/template.yaml
    - scaffolder-templates/gateway/template.yaml


* Explore the Application Source code:
** Go back to the *rhdhub/software-templates* folder
** Click on *scaffolder-templates* and then click on the *quarkus-backend* folder to explore the software templates for the quarkus application.

1 - The *template file* is the one defining your workflow when creating a component. 

* Review the file. The file is composed of parameters and steps. 
* The parameters define the user interaction when creating a new component, you will be asked to:
- *Provide information about the GitLab location*
- *Provide information about the new component*
- *Provide Build Information*
* The steps will be executed once you click the *Create* button on the UI workflow.

2 - The *skeleton* folder represents the application source code. 

* Within the folder you will find the *catalog-info.yaml* file. This file defines the *links* shown on the component overview once the component is created. Contains a link to the *OpenShift* application, *OpenShift Pipelines* and https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[*Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces*^] as part of the developer experience to access an integrated IDE for source code changes.

3 - The application manifests are composed by:

* *argocd* folder with the application definitions to build and deploy the application using GitOps approach with https://docs.openshift.com/gitops/latest/understanding_openshift_gitops/about-redhat-openshift-gitops.html[*Red Hat OpenShift GitOps*^] . 
* *helm/app* folder contains all the manifests to deploy the application using *Helm Charts*. 
* *helm/pipeline* folder contains all the manifests to build the application using https://docs.openshift.com/pipelines/latest/about/understanding-openshift-pipelines.html[*OpenShift Pipelines*^].
