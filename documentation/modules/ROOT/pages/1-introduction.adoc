== 1.1 Introduction to this module

This module shows how developers can build, deploy, and manage applications using Red Hat Developer Hub. Red Hat Developer Hub will allow you to perform the same previous activities with an accelerated approach by reducing developer friction and improving time to market.

The module starts with the product overview, followed by its architecture and a tour of the main functionalities. 
You will implement two use cases, from *maintaining a new application* that requires bug fixing to *modernizing a set of microservices* by moving them into OpenShift.

== 1.2 Red Hat Developer Hub Overview

=== 1.2.1 What is Red Hat Developer Hub?

https://developers.redhat.com/rhdh[Red Hat Developer Hub^] is an enterprise-grade, open system for building developer portals containing a supported and opinionated framework. Red Hat Developer Hub helps reduce friction and frustration for engineering teams while boosting their productivity and increasing their organization's competitive advantages. Red Hat Developer Hub is based on the upstream project https://backstage.spotify.com/[Backstage^] 

Red Hat Developer Hub can build and deploy applications on the hybrid cloud supporting diverse infrastructure such as cloud services and on-prem.

=== 1.2.2 Red Hat Developer Hub Architecture

* *Software Catalog*: a centralized place to keep software metadata for quick discovery and access.
* *Components*: individual software pieces representing an application deployed through Red Hat Developer Hub.
* *Software Templates*: will be used to create components to bring the applications into the platform according to his runtime and specific configurations.
* *Plugins*: Plugins will allow customizations on the Red Hat Developer Hub to include new capabilities such as CI/CD and security insights.

=== 1.2.3 Access Red Hat Developer Hub

Each Software Template is already built based on Application features such as Quarkus, Spring Boot, and Angular. The templates are composed of everything that is required for an application to be built, deployed and managed in *OpenShift*:

- Application Source code
- Application Pipelines based on https://docs.openshift.com/pipelines/latest/about/understanding-openshift-pipelines.html[*OpenShift Pipelines*^]
- Application Manifests using GitOps approach with https://docs.openshift.com/gitops/latest/understanding_openshift_gitops/about-redhat-openshift-gitops.html[*Red Hat OpenShift GitOps*^] and templates with *Helm Charts*.
- https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[*Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces*^] as part of the developer experience to access an integrated IDE for source code changes.

*Software Templates* are built based on best practices to create a repeatable process for developers.
