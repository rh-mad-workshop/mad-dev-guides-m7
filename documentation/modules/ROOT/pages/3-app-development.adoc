== Goals of this lab

This lab aims to explore further modernization by using new software templates. Additionally, it shows how developers can code freely using *Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces*. In this section, you will migrate all the gateway and frontend microservices to complete the deployment of the Cool Store Application.

*Module goals*:

* Create a component for a *NodeJS Application* using existing *software templates* 
* Create a component for a *Java Gateway Application* using existing *software templates* 
* Overview of application details, ArgoCD, and cluster information.
* Explore GitLab issues with RHDH
* Fix a GitLab issue using Red Hat Dev Spaces with Explore software catalog to integrate with other microservices (open API) 
* Review Metrics

== 3.1 Move a Gateway Java application

* Access the Red Hat Developer Hub UI, https://https://developer-hub-rhdhub.%SUBDOMAIN%[Red Hat Developer Hub UI^]

* Login with your OpenShift credentials:

    ** *Username*: `%USERID%`
    ** *Password*: `{openshift-password}`

=== 3.1 Use Software Templates to build and deploy your first Gateway application

* From the left menu, click on *Create*:

* Select the *Quarkus Backend Application* Template:

image:module3/software_templates_gateway.png[width=50%]  

Follow the next steps to create a component based on the pre-defined Software Templates:

*Step 1* - Provide information about the GitLab location :

*Repo Host*: is the GitLab domain already installed in OpenShift. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data to upload the source repository and manifests.

*Sample*: gitlab-gitlab.apps.cluster-jz5bm.sandbox2375.opentlc.com

** ONLY Replace the *xx* with the OpenShift domain:

image:module3/st_gitlab_info.png[width=65%]  


* *Repo Group*: is the GitLab organization already configured. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data to upload the source repository and manifests.

* Click on *Next Step*

*Step 2* - Provide information about the GitLab location :

*Cluster Id*: is the OpenShift domain. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data to build and deploy the application.
*Sample*: .apps.cluster-jz5bm.sandbox2375.opentlc.com

** Replace the *xx* with the OpenShift domain:

image:module3/st_component_clusterid.png[width=65%]  


* *Namespace*:  is the OpenShift namespace. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data to build and deploy the application in that namespace.

** Replace the *N* with the user number:
** Your namespace will be *rhdhub-*`%USERID%`.

image:module3/st_component_namespace.png[width=40%]  



*Note*: Each lab participant is already assigned a unique namespace to be used for all the applications. Each application will have a shared identification based on your user name. 

* *Owner*: The owner is your user ID. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data in the build and deployment process.

** Replace the *N* with the user:
** Your user will be `%USERID%`.

image:module3/st_component_owner.png[width=40%]  

* Click on *Next Step*

*Step 3* - Provide Build information:

* *Image Host*: The application image will be stored in this registry URL. For this lab, we are using the internal registry of OpenShift. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data for the application's build and deployment process.

* *Image Tag*: The image tag used to identify the image. The image will be composed by the application name and tag. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data for the application's build and deployment process.

* *Component ID*: The component ID is the application name. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data for the application's build and deployment process.

** Replace the *N* with *YOUR* user number:
** Your Component ID will be *gateway-app-*`%USERID%`.
