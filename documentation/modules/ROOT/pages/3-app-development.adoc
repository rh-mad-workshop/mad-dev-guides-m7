== Goals of this lab

This lab aims to explore further modernization by using new software templates. Additionally, it shows how developers can code freely using *Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces*. In this section, you will migrate the *gateway* and *frontend* microservices to complete the deployment of the Cool Store Application.

*Module goals*:

* Create a component for a *Frontend NodeJS (Angular) Application* using existing *software templates*.
* Create a component for a *Gateway Java Application* using existing *software templates*.
* Overview of application details, ArgoCD and cluster information.
* Explore GitLab issues with Red Hat Developer Hub.
* Fix a GitLab issue using Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces.
* Explore APIs and application Dependencies.

== 3.1 Move the Gateway Java application

=== 3.1.1 Use Software Templates to build and deploy your first Gateway application

* From the left menu, click on *Create*:

* Select the *Java Gateway Application* Template:

image:module3/software_templates_gateway.png[width=50%]  

Follow the next steps to create a component based on the pre-defined Software Templates:

*Step 1* - Provide information about the GitLab location :

* *Repo Host*: is the GitLab domain already installed in OpenShift. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data to upload the source repository and manifests. 

** Replace the *Repo Host* with the OpenShift domain: 

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
gitlab-gitlab.%SUBDOMAIN%
----

image:module3/st_gitlab_info.png[width=65%]  

* *Repo Group*: is the GitLab organization already configured. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data to upload the source repository and manifests.

* Click on *Next Step*

*Step 2* - Provide information about the GitLab location :

* *Cluster Id*: is the OpenShift domain. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data to build and deploy the application.

** Replace the *Cluster Id* with the OpenShift domain:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
.%SUBDOMAIN%
----

image:module3/st_component_clusterid.png[width=65%]  

* *Namespace*:  is the OpenShift namespace. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data to build and deploy the application in that namespace.

** Replace the *Namespace* with:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
rhdhub-%USERID%
----

image:module3/st_component_namespace.png[width=40%]  

*Note*: Each lab participant is already assigned a unique namespace to be used for all the applications. Each application will have a shared identification based on your user name. 

* *Owner*: The owner is your user ID. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data in the build and deployment process.
** Write your user id: 

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
%USERID%
----

image:module3/st_component_owner.png[width=40%]  

* Click on *Next Step*.

*Step 3* - Provide Build information:

* *Image Host*: The application image will be stored in this registry URL. For this lab, we are using the internal registry of OpenShift. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data for the application's build and deployment process.

* *Image Tag*: The image tag used to identify the image. The image will be composed by the application name and tag. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data for the application's build and deployment process.

* *Component ID*: The component ID is the application name. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data for the application's build and deployment process.

** Replace the *Component ID* using *YOUR* user number: 

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
gateway-app-%USERID%
----

image:module3/st_component_componentid_gateway.png[width=65%]  

* Click on *Next Step*.

* *Review and Create*.

*Sample data*

image:module3/st_component_review_gateway.png[width=80%]  

* Click on *Create*.

=== 3.1.2 Explore the application overview
*Congratulations* you have built your first Java Gateway application with *Red Hat Developer Hub*. It is time to explore the components and explore the application overview.

* With all your activities in green, click *Open Component in catalog*. 

image:module3/task_activity.png[width=65%]  

* RHDH will open a new tab with the component information. 

** Take some time to review the information in the screen:

image:module3/gateway_overview.png[width=100%]  

* Click on *TEKTON* to review your pipeline information.
The pipeline will be triggered in a few seconds. After a few minutes, you will see the pipeline finished as *Succeeded*.

image:module3/gateway_pipelines.png[width=100%] 

* Click on *TOPOLOGY* to review your deployment status.
The deployment will be in *blue* immediately after the pipeline succeeds.

** Click on the deployment *gateway-app-%USERID%*

At your right the application details is available. 

image:module3/gateway_deployment.png[width=80%] 

* Click on *KUBERNETES* to review your application status in the OpenShift cluster.
You might find the pods still not ready. Wait a few seconds to see everything in green.

image:module3/gateway_yourclusters.png[width=100%] 

** Expand the pods information:

image:module3/gateway_kubernetes_clusters_ok.png[width=100%]
